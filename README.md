The **GDPR & Data Compliance Dashboard** is a comprehensive platform designed to help organisations efficiently manage and maintain compliance with GDPR and other data protection regulations. It incorporates several essential features, including interactive data visualisation tools to monitor key compliance metrics, training courses to educate employees on GDPR principles and best practices, and an incident reporting form to quickly address data breaches or security incidents. The dashboard also includes a user-friendly system for handling Data Subject Access Requests (DSAR), allowing individuals to request access to or deletion of their personal data. Powered by a live server, the platform ensures real-time updates and smooth communication, enabling compliance teams to easily track progress and respond to incidents as they arise. This centralised and scalable solution streamlines the entire process of data protection management, making it easier for organisations to stay compliant with evolving regulations.
